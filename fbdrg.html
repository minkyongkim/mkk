	<h2>Motivation</h2>
	<p>Our digitally-connected society today makes information accessible than ever before. Increased circulation of content, however, poses danger when considering the amount of <b>problematic information<sup> 1</sup></b>which can be (and have been) disseminated. This refers to false and misleading online content, such as false news stories<sup> 2</sup>. One example that illustrates the consequences of the much improved information dissemination is when fake social media accounts were intentionally created to spread and manipulate voters' viewpoints to influence Donald Trump's 2016 election.</p>

	<p>This study aims to specifically study "fake news" and its prevalent on many online platforms, but among them social media have been particularly scrutinized. There are two reasons: 1) many people rely on social media for news consumption, and 2) characteristics specific to the platform allow for news to be consumed in unchallenged and receptive ways. 

	<p><sup>1 </sup>Problematic information encompasses specific subsets, two of which are: mis-information and dis-information. Mis-information refers to unintentionally incorrect information; dis-information refers to intentionally correct.

	<h2>Background</h2>
	<h3>What we know from existing literature</h3>
	
	<p>Without going into too much detail, existing literature tells us that:

	<ul>
		<li>Social media algorithms suppress political views opposing those of users</li>
		<li>Selective to political content confirming beliefs in an online social context lead people to share things within their social networks</li>
		<li>Being critical about content consumed on social media and how one is inclined to react to it is one way of countering this issue</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Based on these premises, we initially aimed to explore the design question: How might we support reflection of social media data to promote resilience in a polluted information environment?</p>
</div>
		
<hr>
		
<div id="methods">
	<h2>Approach</h2>

	<p>Our approach was largely motivated by <b>research through design</b>, which aims to generate and advance knowledge of the problem by employing design practices. 

	<center><a href="Images/drg/drg process.png" data-featherlight="image"><img src="Images/drg/drg process.png" style="height:50%; width:50%;"></a></center>

	<br />
		
	<h3>Using Facebook-generated data to create representations that promote self-reflection</h3>

	<p>As Facebook users ourselves, we began by downloading a HTML file of our Facebook data provided by the medium to examine our past activity. The main goal behind this method was to see how we as potential users of the product we aimed to re-design felt about the original visualization of the data generated. We questioned if it allowed us to learn anything about ourselves and to see whether or not it could be improved, and if so how.</p>

	<div class="chart">
		<div class="vis1">
			<a href="Images/drg/vis1.png" data-featherlight="image"><img src="Images/drg/vis1.png" style="height:500px; width:500px;"></a>
		</div>
		
		<div class="vis2">
		<a href="Images/drg/vis2.png" data-featherlight="image"><img src="Images/drg/vis2.png" style="height:500px; width:500px;"></a>
		</div>
	</div>


	<h3>Designing the interaction</h3>

	<p>We realized through producing these graphs and charts that visual representations alone were not enough to provoke any critical reflection; rather, it was our <b>engagement</b> with them. This meant that our potential users would have to actively engage with the representation as we did, by discussing, analyzing, and designing them.</p>
		
	
	<p>We thought about three key things in designing the interaction:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Takeaways - lessons the partcipants should learn from the interaction</li>
			<li>Intended change in participant behavior - e.g. how to read a post, reflecting on initial reactions to post, etc.</li>
			<li>Procedure (of the interaction)</li>
		</ol>

	<p>Each of us used our intended takeaways and behavior change to outline a procedure. Below is my individual contribution.</p>  


	<h4>Intended takeaway for users</h4>

	<p>Translate findings from personal data into insights about their online information consumption practices. Are they able to see how they interact with a certain type of content more than others or spot any patterns? Can they see the possible effects of such online behavior?</p>

	<h4>Intended behavior change for users</h4>

	<p>Be mindful or show the desire to be more mindful about the type of information they consume/propagate.</p>

	<h4>Procedure</h4>

<div id="testing">
	<h2>Testing</h2>

	<h3>Concept testing through pitching</h3>
	<p>We decided to <b>pitch</b>our concept as a form of testing to 6-10 people, followed by a short semi-structured interview to acquire their feedback on the concept. We recorded our key takeaways after each pitch and the total number of participants we managed to "win over".</p>

	<h4>Notes from pitching process</h4> <!--insert snapshots of notes here-->

	</div>
	
	<h3>Outcomes and Key Takeaways</h3>

	<p>21/49 participants, <b>~43%</b> indicated that they would be interested in the concept. In addition, we found that:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><b>Users already feel like they are highly aware when taking action on Facebook.</b> Most users claimed that they were highly conscious of their online persona on Facebook and knew that their actions would be visible to network members.</li>
		<li>Perspectives are not only formed by taking action on posts, but also via content exposure on the feed.</li>
		<li>The opportunity area for design lies before they form initial perception, not after e.g. looking at past activity logs.</li>
	</ol>


</div>

<hr>
	
<div id="iteration">

	<h2>Iteration</h2>

	<p>Based on our findings, we decided to re-define our design requirements:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><b>Make our engagement interaction platform-agnostic, as long as it carries news.</b>Because people felt strongly about their knowledge of Facebook data, we decided that we would have people reflect on <b>any other type of social media they used.</b></li>
		<li><b>Create a "hook" for the interaction by showing them a blog post or video about this topic.</b> The goal here was to set the context, which we found to be critical so people don't surmise things about their behavior.</li>
		<li><b>Ensure that the user somehow engages with their data.</b> Without users engaging with their data, we learned that it was hard to get them to takeaway lessons from the interaction.</li>
		<li><b>Designing in a way that would reveal user takeaways and intentions</b> This is essential to evaluating the success of our exercise design.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Using our redefined design requirements, we individually brainstormed different concepts first before sharing them as a group. We then used the <b>voting method</b> to vote for the top two concepts, iterating on each one before conducting a final user test on the new concept. We used <b>think-aloud protocol</b> because we wanted to observe our users' reactions.</p>

<h3>Final concept design</h3>

<center><a href="Images/drg/concept.png" data-featherlight="image"><img src="Images/drg/concept.png" style="height:50%; width:50%;"></a></center> <!--insert step-by-step picture of concept-->


<h3>Testing phase 2</h3>

<h4>Participant demographics</h4>

<p>Gender: 2 female, 1 male<br />
Age: 18-24 y/o<br />
Levels of political awareness and engagement: one high, one moderate, one low</p>


<h4>Key themes from responses</h4>
<ol>
	<li>All users looked for visual cues to determine authenticity of content, e.g. 'sponsored/promoted' signs</li>
	<li>All users were skeptical of content if presented with less professionalism, e.g. highly polarized messages, grammatical errors, inappropriate word choices</li>
	<li>All users acknowledged their biases in news consumption</li>
	<li>All users generally expressed a sense of powerlessness in being able to control influences from the technology</li>
</ol>

<p>Though we did not manage to assess the degree of success of our exercise due to time constraints, some key indicators of success are:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Psychological indicators of critical thinking.</b> What signs show that people are actively thinking about their information diet and how it might be improved?</li>
	<li><b>Expression of desire to learn more.</b> Do people express the desire to learn more tools that might help them determine authenticity of posts?</li>
	<li><b>Habitually practicing critical thinking (or other intended behavioral adjustments)</b> Though intention does not ensure behavioral change, at least expressing an <i>intention</i> to change is a promising start.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<div id="limitations">
	<h2>Limitations & Next Steps</h2>

	<h3>External validity</h3>
		<p>When users are primed to think about the issue of misinformation and disinformation as in the exercise and subsequently shown examples of fake posts, they seemed to think critically about the post. However, a remaining question is whether users are always in this same <b>mindset or context</b> when browsing through social media feeds.</p>

		<p>In addition, although the type of posts we used were real posts that have appeared on feeds in the past, posts can be fake in more subtle ways.</p>

	<h3>Habitual critical reflection</h3>

	<p>Participants self-reported that they became more aware of their biases in news consumption and thus would take more caution in the future when asked about it specifically in the post-exercise interview. But how likely are they to practice this in real life? That is, unless they form a "habit" of inspecting posts or intentionally set personal goals for an improved information diet, it will be hard to do so without being asked.</p>

	<h3>Future directions</h3>

	<p>Our research-through-design study has furthered knowledge on this topic in the following ways:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>People are aware of their personal biases and influence of algorithms in news consumption on social media</li>
		<li>People are also somewhat aware of strategies that help determine authenticity of posts, such as recognizing visual and textual cues</li>
		<li>Rather than encouraging critical reflection, habitual practice of best practices is key</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Some possible directions for future studies therefore are:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Probing deeper on how much and in what ways people seem to know of their personal biases and effects of technology on news consumption by asking how they would perceive posts on social media, considering factors such as the poster, relationship with poster, etc.</li>
		<li>How people might be more mindful of such internal biases from the outset when browsing their feeds</li>
	</ol>

<div id="takeaways">
	<h2>Takeaways</h2>
	<p><b>Screen participants more rigorously</b></p>
	<p>Even though research-through-design can be more loosely structured, </p>
	<p><b>What users report in retrospect may be different from how they act in the moment</b></p>
	<p>Participant reports of self-presentational concerns involved for each instance of using Reactions might not necessarily be accurate because they were asked to recall a prior experience. Not only is recalling difficult, recalling a feeling is even more of an abstract and challenging task.</p>
