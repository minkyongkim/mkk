	<div id="motivation">
		<h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
		<p>Too much to do, too little time. How often do we hear this phrase cross our minds? Full-time employees today with tight schedules have trouble finding enough time for planning and completing routine errands in their personal lives, especially when errands tend to be less prioritized. Inadequate planning often leads people to become inefficient when it comes to actually running those errands. A few examples of such errands, defined as simple but (mostly) necessary duties that arise as people go about their lives, include but are not limited to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>grocery shopping</li>
			<li>taking mail to the post office</li>
			<li>filling the car with fuel</li>
			<li>taking clothes to dry cleaners</li>
		</ul> 

		<br /><p>How might we tackle this issue by helping full-time employees manage their daily tasks more efficiently on-the-go?</p>
	
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div id="research"> 
		<h2>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</h2>

		<p>We performed primary research to verify our initial assumptions of our target users and understand how full-time employees currently manage and run errands. We conducted research using three different methods: <b>questionnaires, contextual inquiries, and semi-structured phone interviews</b>.</p>

		<br />

		<h4>Questionnaire</h4>

		<p>We created a short online questionnaire to gather mainly quantitative data regarding how people track and run errands. It comprised of 7 questions about the Five Ws and How regarding how people plan and run errands. The questionnaire was distributed across social media sites and drew in a total of 57 responses.</p>

		<p><b>Key Findings</b><br />
			<ol>
				<li>A majority do not need more than 3 days to run errands (94.8%). Most usually take 2 days (50.9%).</li>
				<li>No singular type of method/tool was chosen as most favorable among responses; results were close to even between the three methods: 1) pen and paper, 2) mobile technology, and 3) mental notes.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>


		<h4>Contextual Inquiries</h4>

		<p>Additionally, we aimed to gain qualitative insights by shadowing those who already had upcoming plans to run errands at the time of study. We pre-screened participants to make sure they were both full-time employees and drivers and observed two participants.</p>

		<h4>Semi-structured Phone Interviews</h4>

		<p>For participants we were unable to observe in person and to supplement survey data, we conducted semi-structured phone inteviews. This allowed us to gain more knowledge of people with different methods of planning and running errands not represented in our contextual inquiries. We spoke to a total of 6 participants using guiding questions.</p>

		<h3>Synthesis</h3>
	
	<a href="Images/Erin Images/affinity.png" data-featherlight="image"><img src="Images/Erin Images/affinity.png"></a>

	<p>We then used affinity diagramming to synthesize our qualitative data and found that:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Participants set aside a specific time to run errands</li>
				<li>Participants are highly time sensitive</li>
				<li>Forgetting something is common when running errands</li>
				<li>Planning and prioritizing errands can be difficult</li>
			</ul>

	<div id="concept">
		<h2>DESIGN CONCEPT</h2>
		<p>Our research findings helped us produce design requirements, which we then used to brainstorm various ideas for our product, Erin. After weighing strengths and weaknesses of each idea, we decided on the concept of <b>a mobile voice assistant application which drivers can use to plan and manage errands on-the-road.</b> We believed that in order to create an efficient planning and management tool, the app should include the following features:<br />

		<ol>
			<li>Ability to generate tailored navigation routes based on their to-do lists and the associated location at which each list needs to be completed</li>
			<li>Navigation routes should aim to maximize efficiency, but also be flexible dpeneding on users' schedules</li>
			<li>A reminder function to prevent users from forgetting tasks</li>
			<li>A hands-free way of planning and modifying tasks</li>
			<li>Integration with other existing scheduling tools to assist with planning and execution of tasks</li>
		</ol>

	<div id="prototypes">
		<h2>INITIAL PROTOTYPE</h2>

		<p>To help us visualize the user flow for the app, we created a paper prototype based on design requirements we had specified above.</p>

	<div id="testing">
		<h2>USABILITY TESTING</h2>
		
		<h3>Test Plan</h3>
		<p>We completed a total of two rounds of usability studies and iterations to improve our design, using each to advance to a higher fidelity design. Our usability test plan differed between the first and second rounds.
		Our first round involved:<br /><br />
			<b>Part 1:</b> Use tactile commands to navigate the application to complete tasks<br /><br />
			<b>Part 2:</b> Voice out the vocal commands that would be used to complete the same set of tasks in Part 1. (We did this to observe what were natural speech patterns for users so that we could incorporate these into our mid-fidelity prototype.<br /><br />
		Our second round involved:<br /><br />
			<b>Part 1:</b> Use tactile commands to navigate the application to complete tasks<br /><br />
			<b>Part 2:</b> Use a combination of tactile and voice commands to complete the same set of tasks in Part 1<br /><br />
			
			In both instances, participants were instructed to visualize a hypothetical situation in which they are planning a party. They were then given the prototype displayed on a laptop and asked to complete the following tasks:</p>
			<a href="Images/Erin Images/task-list.png" data-featherlight="image"><img src="Images/Erin Images/task-list.png"></a>
		

		<p>Task completion and errors for each task were recorded. After testing, we also measured satisfaction levels using open-ended questions (e.g. What would you change about the app?)</p>
		
	</div>

	<div id="iteration">
		<h2>ITERATIONS</h2>
		
		<h3>Results from First UT</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Terminology used was not clear and did not match participants expectations, e.g. participants had difficulty understanding what the CTA "Execute List" meant.</li>
			<li>Not enough visual cues and affordances indicated which part of interface is interactive, e.g. no UI to show that they could their reminders could be edited in the calendar screen.</li>
			<li>Confusion occurred when interaction patterns did not follow conventions, e.g. “saving” selections, automatically saved task lists, etc.</li>

		</ol>
		
		<p>To prioritize which areas to fix, we also rated each usability issue discovered for severity, with 1 being most severe and 4 being a minor preference issue. The changes are reflected in the 
			mid-fi prototype below.</p>

		<h3>Results from the Second UT</h3>
			
		<p>Compared to our first session, we had relatively fewer changes to make. Nevertheless, we learned that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Lack of clear UI and visual feedback prevented participants from discovering or fully understanding how to use specific features, e.g. no visual feedback to show speech processing is active.</li>
				<li>Entry points for certain tasks were unclear, e.g. participants clicked on the to-do list tab in the main nav bar to reschedule reminders, instead of the Reminders tab.</li> 
			</ol>
			
			
		<p>We iterated in four key ways from our mid to high fidelity prototype:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create UI for when microphone is actively listening</li>
				<li>Include more than one entry points for certain use cases, e.g. scheudling/re-scheduling reminders</li>
				<li>Change trip completion time to show a shorter completion time than primary route</li>
				<li>Other minor visual cues/UI tweaks for clearer display of affordances, e.g. inserting placeholder text in the search bar for preferences to indicate what is being searched.</li>
			</ol>

		<h2>TAKEAWAYS</h2>

		<p><b>Avoiding a solution-first mindset</b></p>
		<p>Thinking in a solution-first mindset can lead to an overly narrow focus that does not consider a more comprehensive range of use cases when specifying design requirements. Though failing to define use cases is problematic, designing for too few use cases is equally dangerous because the wrong features, for example, may be prioritized.</p>

		<p><b>Defining a specific target user group before primary research</b></p>
		<p>In order to ask the right questions and gather the right information during research, it is imperative that we correctly identify the target users first. This not only helps to discover opportunity areas, but also provides a clearer design direction.
