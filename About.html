		<p>Hi there! I'm Minkyong. I'm an aspiring UX researcher and a graduate student currently earning my Master's degree in <b>Human-Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE)</b> at the <b>University of Washington.</b></p>
		<p>I get extremely passionate about solving problems within constraints using both research and data. I strongly believe in creating meaningful online experiences for people in various contexts. </p>
			<p>Prior to UW, I was an undergraduate student at <b>Northwestern University</b>, studying Communication Studies, Cognitive Science, and Integrated Marketing Communications.</p>
		<p>While there, I wrote on honors thesis on self-presentational concerns people hold when disclosing their emotions on Facebook, which can be found <a href="https://arch.library.northwestern.edu/concern/generic_works/3f462547h">here</a>.</p>
		<p>When not immersed in design, I can be found hunting for caffeine, travelling, or enjoying the outdoors.</p>
			<h3>Research Interests</h3>
			<p id="research">Based on my prior experience with academic research, I am broadly interested in computer-mediated communication, helping users better engage with technologies that promote social interaction in various contexts. I am also
			interested in how people use technologies for everyday work and play.</p><br />
